<h3>Sliding Window</h3>
<div>
<p>
This pattern involves creating a window which can either be an array or number 
from one position to another
</p>
<p>
Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes(and a 
new window is created).

Very usefull for keeping track of a subset of data in and array/string etc.
